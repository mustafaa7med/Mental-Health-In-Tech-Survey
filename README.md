# San Francisco Governmental-Based Jobs Salaries
## Understanding how salaries are in the government of San Francisco and how it differs.

With many states in the US being kinda different from each other, especially in terms of salaries, I was curious to analyze the county of California and in particular governmental-based jobs.


### Questions answered in this project

- How do the average base, overtime, other, and total pay differ?

- What are the top-paid departments?

### Dataset and Tech Stack
- You can download the dataset through the following link on Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/sf-salaries)
- **Tech Stack:** SQLite
- **Functionalities:** SELECT, Subqueries, GROUP BY, Analytical SQL (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROWS BETWEEN, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, OVER, PARTITION BY)

------------------------------------------------------

```sql
-- How the average base, overtime, other and total pay differ?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(BasePay)) AS AVG_BASE,
       ROUND(AVG(OvertimePay)) AS AVG_OVERTIME,
       ROUND(AVG(OtherPay)) AS AVG_OTHER,
       ROUND(AVG(TotalPay)) AS AVG_TOTAL
FROM Salaries;
```
**Output:**

|  AVG_BASE    |  AVG_OVERTIME  |   AVG_OTHER    |   AVG_TOTAL    |
|     :---:    |     :---:      |     :---:      |     :---:      |
| 66054        | 5066           |       3649     |  74768         |

**Insight:**
- Overtime and other pay benefits are not a huge factor in terms of the total pay.

------------------------------------------------------

```sql
-- What are the highest paid 10 jobs?
SELECT JobTitle, ROUND(TotalPay)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT JobTitle,
					  TotalPay,
					  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY JobTitle ORDER BY TotalPay DESC) AS RNK
					  FROM Salaries) AS Ranked_Data
WHERE Ranked_Data.RNK = 1
LIMIT 10;
```
**Output:**

|  JobTitle    |  MAX_SALARY    |
|     :---:    |     :---:    |
| ADMINISTRATIVE ENGINEER | 149322.23 |
| ADMINISTRATIVE ANALYST III | 92847 |
| ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES MANAGER | 92002 |

| ACPO,JuvP, Juv Prob (SFERS) | 62290.78 |
| ACCOUNT CLERK | 60838.2 |
| ACCOUNTANT INTERN | 58799.53 |

**Insight:**
- Half of the top highest paid employees do have an administrative role.

------------------------------------------------------

```sql

-- How salary trends overtime based on each job title?
SELECT Year, ROUND(AVG(TotalPay)) AS AVG_TOTAL_PAY,
			 ROUND(AVG(BasePay)) AS AVG_BASE_PAY,
			 ROUND(AVG(OvertimePay)) AS AVG_OVERTIME_PAY,
			 ROUND(AVG(OtherPay)) AS AVG_OTHER_PAY
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year, AVG_TOTAL_PAY;
```

**Output:**

|  Year  |  AVG_TOTAL_PAY |  AVG_BASE_PAY |  AVG_OVERTIME_PAY |  AVG_OTHER_PAY |  
|     :---:  |   :---:    |   :---:    |   :---:    |   :---:    |    
|  2011 | 71744 | 63596 | 4531 | 3617 | 
|  2012 | 74113 | 65436 | 5023 | 3653 | 
|  2013 | 77611 | 68510 | 5282 | 3820 | 
|  2014 | 75464 | 66557 | 5401 | 3505 | 

**Insight:**
- The average pay rate has increased from 2011 till 2013 yet it declined.
- Despite the increase in the average pay rate of overtime yet the base salary itself got declined.

------------------------------------------------------

```sql
-- What are the 3 top highest paid jobs segregated by each year?
SELECT JobTitle,
	   Year,
	   TotalPay
FROM (SELECT JobTitle,
			 Year,
			 TotalPay,
			 RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY TotalPay DESC) AS RNK
	  FROM Salaries) AS RANKED_DATA
WHERE RANKED_DATA.RNK <= 3;
```
**Output:**

|  JobTitle   |  Year   |  TotalPay   | 
|     :---:  |     :---:  |     :---:  |  
|  GENERAL MANAGER-METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY | 2011 | 567595.43 |

- Captain III recorded the top 2 and 3 highest paid roles in 2011 while Asst Med Examiner recorded the highest 2 and 3 in 2014.

SELECT DISTINCT JobTitle,
                MAX(TotalPay) AS MAX_PAY
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY JobTitle
HAVING JobTitle LIKE '%DEPARTMENT%'
ORDER BY MAX_PAY DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
